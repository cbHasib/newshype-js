        postTitle: 'Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions',
        postDetails: 'Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.',

        postTitle: '.forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .find()... What is the difference?',
        postDetails: '.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. .find() checks every element in an array to find a specific element and the value of the first element that passes a test.',

        postTitle: 'Why would you use template string?',
        postDetails: 'Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.',
